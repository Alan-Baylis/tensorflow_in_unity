Proof of concept for running [TensorFlow](tensorflow.org) in Unity.

### Requirements

A Unity with .NET 4.6 equivalency support is necessary.

Uses TensorFlowSharp to access TensorFlow.  (Windows build confirmed working with TensorFlowSharp 1.2.2)

1. Managed DLL must be present (TensorFlowSharp.dll)
2. Native DLLs must be present (libtensorflow.* for target platform)
3. Managed DLL needs System.ValueTuple, which came from the CSharp vNext Support Unity package. (Windows build confirmed working with CSharp70Support 3.2.3)

1 and 2 came from the TensorFlowSharp nuget package, extracted as a RAR.

3 came from some helpful fellow on bitbucket.  See https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/c-6-0.314297/page-7
